> _Momentum Mod is a standalone game built on the Source Engine, aiming to
> centralize movement gametypes found in CS:S, CS:GO, and TF2._

This is a small repository for centralizing styling and UI elements shared
across Momentum Mod. Our base game and dashboard site use different UI systems
(Panorama and Angular respectively), this repo produces content usable by both,
such as fonts and color palettes, and anything else we need in the future.

Nothing in this repo is likely to change often, so built/exported content is
here and may be imported directly by parent repos; no compile is needed unless
you've updated something. See subdirs for build steps.
